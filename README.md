XMPP Bot for Games, Eve Powered

The plan is to have a "Russian Roulette" style Jabber Bot, where up to 6 players can join, one will be eliminated each round.

Each person will be asked to "buy in" to the game, with ISK (Virtual Currency from EVE Online), and the winner of the game will get the majority of the pot (the leftover being a house share)
